What is Metis Bridge?

* Metis Bridge is a tool that helps you transfer tokens between different networks. You can use Metis Bridge to send ETH and Metis tokens from mainnet or testnets to Andromeda or Stardust.

Where is Metis Bridge used in the Ethereum ecosystem?

* You can use the Metis Bridge solution to transfer tokens or NFTs between L1 and L2.

How much does it cost to bridge?

* ETH is needed to bridge METIS from Ethereum L1 to Andromeda L2. Once Metis is on L2, transactions will be paid for in METIS, which will start off at a few bucks and eventually cost only a few cents.
