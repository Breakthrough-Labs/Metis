# Metis Bridge

### Using A Unique Approach to Bridge Between L1 & L2

Metis Bridge allows you to transfer Ethereum tokens from layer 1 blockchain to layer 2. You can make use of this feature to bridge Ethereum tokens to the Metis Andromeda network that extends the capabilities of regular testnets and development platforms.

You can use Metis Bridge to transfer tokens between testnets or mainnets. You need to set up your MetaMask account and connect to the Metis mainnet (Andromeda) and Metis testnet (Goerli).

### Adding the Metis Testnet and Mainnet <a href="#_91qdkyrnmc0i" id="_91qdkyrnmc0i"></a>

After setting up your MetaMask account, you can use Metis Bridge to bridge tokens between networks. MetaMask is a great tool for managing Ethereum transactions and having all information in one place. But, if you want to achieve a bunch of additional features, you can set up your Polis account. Polis is a unique web-based console like MetaMask that offers more capabilities than MetaMask.

Make sure you have added Andromeda (Metis Mainnet) to your MetaMask account. Follow the instructions given in [this link](../resources/metamask-setting-how-to-connect-your-metamask-crypto-wallet-to-metis-platform.md) to add it to your account or simply follow the next steps.

### Transferring ETH to Your Account <a href="#_i16jl1t6ezgn" id="_i16jl1t6ezgn"></a>

To start a project on L2 Ethereum, you will need to transfer your Metis test tokens using the Metis Bridge method. It doesn’t take much time and you can perform the process in a few minutes.

Once you have enough Metis tokens in your account, you can use Metis Bridge to transfer them from L1 to L2.

Here is the [Metis Bridge platform](https://bridge.metis.io/) that allows you to do the process. Click on the “connect account” button to connect your MetaMask to Metis Bridge. Then you can see that Metis Bridge allows you to transfer from a testnet like Rinkeby to Goerli.

Note that you need enough Metis test tokens in your account to be able to transfer them from Rinkeby (Layer 1) to Metis Goerli (Layer 2). If you don’t have any Metis test tokens, head over to this [link ](../get-started/getting-test-tokens.md)and get some by following a few steps.

* Transferring from L1 to L2 may take 1 to 2 minutes to complete. But, if you want to transfer from L2 to L1, it may take 7 days. The process is long to prevent fraud issues.

### Metis Mainnet Andromeda <a href="#_1r37mz9ztkti" id="_1r37mz9ztkti"></a>

Bridging between Ethereum mainnet and the Metis mainnet (Andromeda) is a unique feature that you can have using the Metis bridge method. First, make sure you have switched to the Ethereum mainnet or Andromeda mainnet in your MetaMask account.

Now, you can use the Metis Bridge capability to transfer tokens between L1 (Ethereum mainnet) and L2 (Metis Andromeda).

### Confirming Transactions <a href="#_lt9hjy8p67ci" id="_lt9hjy8p67ci"></a>

Etherscan Account Explorer allows you to see all the details about your transactions. You can simply use MetaMask and open Etherscan Explorer to see the latest transactions and their addresses.

### Using Metis Polis Instead of MetaMask <a href="#_a4wc70ctrzz1" id="_a4wc70ctrzz1"></a>

If you want to access a range of features, you can sign up on Polis. First, double check that you added the Metis testnet and mainnet to your MetaMask. Now, use [this link](https://polis.metis.io/#/login) to connect your wallet.

You can use your MetaMask account address to sign in. Also, there is an option to sign up with your email address and password.

To sign in with your MetaMask account, click on “Connect with Metamask” and confirm the process.

By signing in to the Polis account and connecting to Metis Bridge, you will see a window like this one to bridge your tokens between L1 and L2. Note that you can request Metis test tokens using your Polis account but it needs a small amount of ETH test tokens. If your balance is zero, you can get ETH test tokens using [https://faucets.chain.link/](https://faucets.chain.link/).
