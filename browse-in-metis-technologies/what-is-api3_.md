### What is API3? <a href="#_1dzp8gm4br0c" id="_1dzp8gm4br0c"></a>

API3 is an Ethereum token that aims at powering the API3 project. The main goal of the API3 project is to connect the traditional APIs to the blockchain network. API3 can be called the next generation of the oracles that connect the blockchain ecosystem to external data sources.

API3 project was launched in December 2020, and it enables dapps to access real-world data and services. Accessing real-world datasets is a crucial point for developing decentralized applications, and there is a big problem that traditional approaches couldn't serve the Web 3.0 ecosystem.

As a result, API3’s mission is to adapt existing APIs to Web 3.0 standards. The API3’s novel approach is the dAPI solution, also called decentralized API, that gives developers a great feature to integrate data retrieval into their smart contracts. API3 provides the following benefits for the development and deployment of Web 3.0 solutions.

* Security
* Speed
* Ease of access
* Efficiency
* Data-source transparency

### What are First-party and Third-party Oracles? <a href="#_3bllq4c66u3a" id="_3bllq4c66u3a"></a>

Oracles are the gateway to access off-chain data and use it in Web 3.0 projects. A first-party oracle uses its own API and provides data directly for the blockchain network.

A third-party oracle makes use of a third-party API to pass the process and provide the required data.

In such an ecosystem, first-party oracles that use native APIs offer higher levels of security than third-party oracles. A third-party oracle must pass through an intermediary provider that could be unsafe and trustless.

So, API3 is our unique solution to turn first-party oracles into action using Airnode.

### What is Airnode? <a href="#_gk3qjp6dkyl" id="_gk3qjp6dkyl"></a>

Airnode is an open-source solution and Web 3.0 API middleware that allows developers to connect existing APIs to blockchain apps. Airnode is the solution of the API3 project and it gives API providers the opportunity to run their own oracle nodes.

Airnode acts as the brain of the API3 project, and first-party oracles can reach their goals using this approach.

### API3 DAO <a href="#_49x7itkru737" id="_49x7itkru737"></a>

API3 DAO is responsible for managing dAPIs and it provides transparency and trust when creating and using dAPIs. The governance in such an ecosystem is decentralized and transparent and it’s necessarily needed to create truly decentralized Web 3.0 applications and solutions.

Metis has developed its oracle solutions and it’s helping developers and organizations deploy their dapps and get access to external data sources. Metis oracle provides different methods such as DIA and API3 solutions for developers to achieve a range of Web 3.0 and blockchain features.
