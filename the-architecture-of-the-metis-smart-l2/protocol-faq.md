# Protocol FAQ

## How does Metis Maintain a Constant Uptime?

The system is designed in a way that any malfunctioning actor gets charged and swapped out through the constant cycles of rotation. It is accomplished with the Peer Network which includes Sequencers, Verifiers, and Block Producers.

## What is the Peer Network?

It is a network of decentralized actors (nodes) that serve the Metis system. Anyone can become a part of the Peer Network just by setting up a [node](https://github.com/ericlee42/metis-verifier-node) on their computer. The participants of the Peer Network receive revenue with a portion of the fees from all the transactions that go through the Peer Network.

## Where does Metis Store the Transaction Data?

Metis stores the transaction data in Memolabs storage and the Peer Network.

## If Memolabs goes down, will the System still Operate?

Yes, in this case the Verifier downloads the transaction data from the Peer Network.
