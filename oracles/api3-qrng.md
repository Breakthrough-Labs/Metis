Quantum Random Number Generation is an ideal solution for dapp developers to design highly secure smart contracts. Protecting smart contracts is a crucial point in the case of Web 3.0 development and quantum technology helps developers reach out the solution.

[API3](https://api3.org/QRNG) is partnered with the leading research groups and quantum technology providers to bring security and reliability to dapp developers. API3 provides developers with truly random numbers at no charge and users only need to pay for gas fees.

### Why Use RNG? <a href="#_almvsmdn8f36" id="_almvsmdn8f36"></a>

Smart contract platforms generally cannot generate random numbers which are essential parts of developing smart contracts and dapps. We need truly random numbers in order to prove the security of our code.

Quantum Random Number Generation is a result of collaborating API3 with [The Australian National University (ANU) Quantum Optics Group](https://quantumnumbers.anu.edu.au/) which gives well-secure random numbers. The result of a quantum event is truly uncertain which results in a verified standard for random number generation.

[QRNG](https://docs.api3.org/qrng/) is a random number generator based on quantum phenomena and you can integrate it into your projects. Metis serves [first-party oracles](https://medium.com/api3/api3-and-metis-partner-to-serve-first-party-oracles-to-their-l2-rollup-ecosystem-dcb499cab761) in collaboration with the API3 project and you can now access a broad range of [Web 3.0 APIs](https://www.api3.org/apis) to connect your smart contracts to external data sources.

Technologies like QRNG and Airnode give an opportunity to achieve faster, cheaper, and safer transactions and dapp development. QRNG is based on [Airnode](https://docs.api3.org/airnode/v0.7/) which is a unique solution for the API3 project to access external data sources. So, you can use it and integrate it into your decentralized application projects easily.

### Where Can We Use the Solution For? <a href="#_hh8m1tgq0uei" id="_hh8m1tgq0uei"></a>

QRNG is a tested and verified solution by the ANU quantum optics group and you can make use of this approach for dapp development in the following areas:

* Gaming
* NFTs
* IoT interactions
* Payment apps
* All over the Web 3.0 digital world

### What Are the Characteristics? <a href="#_irefcw7ej7ix" id="_irefcw7ej7ix"></a>

API3 QRNG is hosted by the ANU group in AWS. The generated random numbers have unique characteristics as below:

* They are never reused or served to multiple requests
* They are encrypted on AWS servers
* They are destroyed after being served and no one can access them afterward
* They are provided at no charge and dapp developers only need to pay for gas
