# The Architecture of the Metis L2

Metis has focused on the optimistic rollup which aims at reducing the time and cost of performing transactions. In recent years, the number of Ethereum transactions has surged resulting in expensive transactions. Metis L2 rollup utilizes an exclusive method that is fraud-proof and meets our high security and data availability requirements.

You will experience very low gas fees, reduced from around $2-3 to around $0.02-0.14. More importantly, the Metis L2 rollup offers low latency and high availability which are essential requirements within the Web 3.0 ecosystem and the Ethereum blockchain.

In this section, we are going to explain the Metis architecture and the way transactions are performed and verified.
