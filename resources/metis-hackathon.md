### Important Notes to Care About <a href="#_sumnc9av0fyf" id="_sumnc9av0fyf"></a>

There is a simple goal for the Metis hackathon. You will take part in building new Ethereum Dapps or porting an existing Ethereum Dapp onto the Metis layer 2 ecosystem. This is a great chance for Web 3.0 developers and enthusiasts to join a helpful workshop and get to know how Web 3.0 solutions and methodologies are implemented.

The main focus points for Dapp development and deployment are as follows:

* Low gas fees
* Fast and secure transactions
* Error-free compatibility with EVM
* Integration of Dapps into Web 2 and Web 3 ecosystems
* Focusing on decentralization and security within the Ethereum blockchain
* Using no-code capabilities to create smart contracts
* Attracting investors that are forming DAOs on the Metis platform
* Creating exclusive tokens without coding
* Using built-in and inexpensive IPFS storage
* Participating in builder mining rewards program
