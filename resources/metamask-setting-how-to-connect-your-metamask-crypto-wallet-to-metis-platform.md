# MetaMask Setting, How to Connect Your MetaMask Crypto Wallet to Metis Platform?

MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to store and exchange digital tokens. More importantly, MetaMask makes it possible to interact with decentralized applications(DAAPs). Web 3 is the next generation of the internet and is based on cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. So, we can call MetaMask the gateway to the world of web 3.

MetaMask is a crypto wallet that you can add to your chrome browser easily and it serves as an Ethereum wallet. The main purpose of using MetaMask is to perform transactions on the Ethereum platform, and ERC-20 tokens can be stored and transferred between addresses using MetaMask.

By using MetaMask and connecting to DAAPs, you can spend your coins on decentralized applications and games. Thus, we can enter the world of decentralized applications and web 3 platforms by making use of the MetaMask wallet in a blink of an eye.

As an Ethereum layer 2 platform, Metis provides you with simplicity and speed to access web 3 features and you can set a MetaMask and Metis connection via exploring this link: [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/)

#### Step 6 <a href="#_iiqeespq5lty" id="_iiqeespq5lty"></a>

You also need a security phrase to recover your wallet at any time needed and the recovery phrase helps you protect your data and wallet and proves it is safe. The security recovery phrase for the MetaMask wallet is a 12-word phrase, and it’s the master key to access your wallet. Note that you must save and protect your security phrase and you should never share the security phrase with everyone.

Let’s click on the “Next” button to see the secret recovery phrase. You can download the phrase or save it to use in the future.
