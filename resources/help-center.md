### Frequently Asked Questions <a href="#_qvgu41w5eky" id="_qvgu41w5eky"></a>

Help yourself with a range of FAQs, including almost all user questions and their full answers.

Please introduce Metis to us in one statement?

* Metis is a later 2 rollup infrastructure to support the running of the Web 3.0 economy.

What is new in your Layer 2 technology solution?

* We offer many forms of technical as well as customer experience improvements. One main difference is the use of multiple sequencers and L2 Rangers in order to ensure network security and fast withdrawal times from our Layer 2 compared to other Optimistic rollup solutions such as Optimism and Arbitrum. We also have an integrated Memolabs storage solution and a permission system to manage your participants in your Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC). We are also planning on integrating a reputation system that is tracked through the use of NFTs. Our current goals include introducing smart contract templates to make it simple to create, deploy, and manage your smart contracts, even if you do not have any direct smart contract development experience.

How does Metis plan to deal with technology and security concerns for cryptocurrencies?

* Metis focuses on both the speed and the security of the ecosystem. We employ multiple sequencers as well as L2 rangers, which act as incentivized auditors. These solutions ensure fast and secure transactions and withdrawals on and from the Metis layer 2 platform.
