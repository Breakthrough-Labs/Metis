### What Are Test Tokens? <a href="#_1sjogyfhssix" id="_1sjogyfhssix"></a>

Crypto coins and tokens both refer to value when speaking about blockchain technology, but they have a fundamental difference. A cryptocurrency coin is a digital asset native to the blockchain. Bitcoin is native to the bitcoin network, and Ether is the native coin for the Ethereum network.

Besides crypto coins, there is one more type of digital asset that is called a Token. A token usually doesn't have an independent blockchain and network, and it uses the Bitcoin or Ethereum network protocols as its structure. Tether, Polygon, and Metis are examples of crypto tokens that inherently expand the features of native networks like the Ethereum network.

### How to Get ETH Test Tokens from Testnets? <a href="#_77lvo22sy7d4" id="_77lvo22sy7d4"></a>

Before your project is launched and deployed on the main Ethereum platform, you need to use an Ethereum test network (“testnet”) that simulates the main platform. Using this option, developers can test their projects before they deploy them on the Ethereum mainnet. At the moment, you can get Ethereum test tokens to be used on testnets from the three options as follows:

* [**Ropsten**](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/): A proof-of-work blockchain and an Ethereum testnet that allows developers to deploy on a test network before the mainnet deployment. Ropsten is the pioneer of the testnets.
* [**Kovan**](https://kovan.etherscan.io/): Kovan is another option to get Ethereum test tokens, and it's a proof-of-authority blockchain. You need to submit a request for test tokens on this testnet.
* [**Rinkeby**](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/): Rinkeby is a proof-of-authority blockchain, and it is one of the popular testnets for the Ethereum network. You need to submit a request to get test tokens on Rinkeby.

You can use all of these testnets with your MetaMask wallet and get Ethereum test tokens (ETH), But you can only use the Rinkeby testnet alongside the Metis bridge to transfer tokens from L1 to L2. It’s up to you to choose from the three options and connect your project to the desired test network.

**Note that the Metis platform is only integrated with Rinkeby. So, you can get test tokens from the Rinkeby network and transfer them from L1 to L2.**

### Connecting Your Account to a Testnet and Configuring MetaMask <a href="#_lqece5oacmub" id="_lqece5oacmub"></a>

There are some steps to configure MetaMask to be able to connect to an Ethereum testnet. First, download MetaMask, create a new wallet, and enter your MetaMask account.

### Steps to Getting Metis Test Tokens <a href="#_orlwnkcv4bo3" id="_orlwnkcv4bo3"></a>

You can get Metis test tokens using different options. First, it would be better to have a basic knowledge of the L1 & L2 Ether blockchain.

* L1: Layer 1 is the native settlement layer of a blockchain network. For example, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are layer 1 blockchain networks. Performing transactions on the L1 blockchain is expensive and that is why Metis started to provide L2 Ethereum transactions.
* L2: Layer 2 blockchain is built on top of the existing blockchain system and it’s an overlaying network to solve the main challenges of L1 blockchain, including speed performance and the cost of transactions.

### Getting Metis Tokens On the Layer 1 Blockchain <a href="#_8jxoft9grzn2" id="_8jxoft9grzn2"></a>

#### Step 1 <a href="#_5h4keiuzw8i2" id="_5h4keiuzw8i2"></a>

In order to get Metis tokens, you need to create a new MetaMask wallet and configure your wallet. Switch to the Rinkeby testnet, and then you can see your account balance.

#### Step 2 <a href="#_si7tusoexsl8" id="_si7tusoexsl8"></a>

You need to import the Metis token using “Import tokens” at the bottom of the MetaMask window. Click on “Import tokens” to add the Metis token to your account.

MetaMask will move to the next page and you need to enter “Token Contract Address” and “Token Symbol”. Use the following information and click on the “Add Custom Token” button.

* Token Contract Address: \[0xe552fb52a4f19e44ef5a967632dbc320b0820639]
* Token Symbol: Metis

#### Step 4 <a href="#_ox8edldeawjt" id="_ox8edldeawjt"></a>

Now you would see the Metis token added to your account and you can see your Metis token balance. There is 0 Ether balance and 0 Metis balance, and you need to take a few steps to

increase your account balance.

#### Step 5 <a href="#_n8y4zrysqjsu" id="_n8y4zrysqjsu"></a>

Before taking the next step that gives you Metis tokens, you need to get some Rinkeby Ether. This step is to obtain some Ether on Rinkeby to be able to pay for gas fees and then you can receive Metis tokens during the next step.

There are many options to get Rinkeby Ether, including the following methods:

**Getting Rinkeby ETH Using Chainlink**

1. Chainlink offers a reliable method and gives you the opportunity to have Rinkeby Ether to increase your account balance. Open [https://faucets.chain.link/](https://faucets.chain.link/) and follow the next steps to receive Rinkeby Ether.
