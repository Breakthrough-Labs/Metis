# Getting Test Tokens

### Step1: Getting Metis Test Tokens On Rinkeby <a href="#_z98tmu8zem2" id="_z98tmu8zem2"></a>

Head over to [https://rinkeby-faucet.metis.io/](https://rinkeby-faucet.metis.io/) to get your Metis tokens easily. The platform allows you to get Metis test tokens every 24 hours, and you need to have enough ETH to pay gas fees and proceed with this step.

There is a need to bridge Metis tokens from Rinkeby (testnet) to Stardust (Metis testnet) after getting test tokens.

### Step2: Transferring Tokens From Layer 1 to Layer 2 <a href="#_fdz6ur7n5d5c" id="_fdz6ur7n5d5c"></a>

The Metis Bridge method helps you transfer your funds between Layer 1 and Layer 2. Let’s open the link [https://bridge.metis.io/](https://bridge.metis.io/) to start everything from scratch.

After opening the link, you have an option to connect your MetaMask account to the Metis Bridge. Click on the “Connect Account” button to continue.

A MetaMask notification page will open, and you can select your MetaMask account to be connected to the Metis Bridge.

Check the network list on MetaMask to see that Metis Stardust Testnet was added to the list.

Now, use [https://bridge.metis.io/home](https://bridge.metis.io/home) to transfer your Metis tokens from Layer 1 to Layer 2. Note that your MetaMask test network must be set to Rinkeby testnet to be able to transfer the tokens from L1 to L2.

Set the amount you want to transfer and click on the “Approve” button. A MetaMask window will open, and you can confirm the process to be started. Note that the process will take a few seconds and will show you a success message after completion.

After a successful transfer, you can change your test network on MetaMask to Metis Stardust Testnet and see the account balance.
